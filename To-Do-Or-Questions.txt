This is a file to address questions/issues as well as to list off what to code for our script.

1. How to fecth for pdbs

We have the database in /share/siegellab/software/wilson/all_pdbs/all_pdbs/

Now do we need to update this database? Or is what we have enough? Is there a reason to have this on the cluster vs using clean PDB.. 

Tim: I use clean_pdb from Rosetta

2. Which alignement tool.

Tim: I use muscle
Promals OR Muscle?

They are very similar but Muscle doesn't give grishin alignment and we have to run the extra function to get it there. Looks like promals is the better option. Also promals give us a family alignment for us to use in the regular constraints file. Not too sure how Robetta works tho

3. Sequence trim

We can make this an option for if we want to trim. just python script.py -trim.... That should be easy.
 
Tim: I trim end of overhang. Minimum overhang?
- here are you doing N term?

4. Threaded PDBs

We can do this already 

5 Robetta?
What files do we need for this? 

6. Two ways to do Cat. constraints: Catalytic Geometric (CG, Alph-Alph, Alph-Beta, etc.; aka Steve's or SB) and/or 6 DOF


7. Include GDT into xml?
Tim: I've incorporated GDT against threaded models into mine

8. Analysis? separate script?

Yeah us 3 have a generic one that we can pull down that people can just run off jupyter notebook in their working directory when looking at their .sc files

9. Meant to work on enzyme families OR just a single target at a time?
Not sure what the biggest difference moving to families is. 

10. Other?
Sorry for the formatting I didn't pull before I did my comments
We doing python 2 or 3?
